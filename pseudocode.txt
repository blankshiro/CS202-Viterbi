S is the state space = {s1, s2, ..., sK}, where K is the number of possible states.

X is the observation space = {x1, x2, ..., xZ}, where Z is the number of possible observations (note: not used in both code and pseudocode)

Initial is the array of starting probabilities = {i1, i2, ..., ik}.

T is the transition matrix K x K such that T[i][j] stores the transition probability of transiting from state si to state sj.

E is the Emission matrix K x Z such that E[i][j] stores the probability of observing oj from state si.

O is the observation list = {o1, o2, ..., oN}, where N is the number of observations in the observation sequence.
