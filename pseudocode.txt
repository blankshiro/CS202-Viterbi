S is the state space = {s1, s2....sk}.

Initial is the array of starting probabilities = {i1, i2, i3,....ik}.

T is the transition matrix K x K such that T[i][j] stores the transition probability of transiting from state si to state sj.

E is the Emission matrix K x N such that E[i][j] stores the probability of observing oj from state si.

O is the observation list = {o1, o2, o3, o4...on}
